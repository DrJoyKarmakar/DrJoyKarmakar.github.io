<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am Dr. Joy Karmakar, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), working at the intersection of drug discovery, fluorescent diagnostics, and chemical biology. Trained as a synthetic chemist, I specialize in developing small-molecule inhibitors and chemical probes with translational potential in gastrointestinal and pulmonary disorders.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
My current work at UCSF includes the development of selective inhibitors targeting ion transporters such as SLC26A6 (PAT1) and SLC26A4 (pendrin) for potential therapeutic use in cystic fibrosis and other epithelial transport disorders. In parallel, I independently lead a research initiative on xylazine detection, where I am developing a novel fluorescent probe to address the rising public health crisis linked to opioid-adulterant abuse.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Originally from Jhalda, a remote and underserved region of West Bengal in eastern India, I began my academic journey at Presidency College, Kolkata, before pursuing my masterâ€™s at the University of Hyderabad and earning my Ph.D. in chemistry from Ariel University, Israel. Throughout this journey, I have remained committed to integrating molecular design with diagnostic innovation, focusing on problems that bridge the clinic and the bench.
